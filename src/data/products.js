        description: "Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability-all in one layer-was refined. The result is a featherweight, formfitting and virtually seamless upper.",

        description: "Nike Free technology is designed for natural motion. It gives your feet the freedom they need - so you can walk the way you want. The laser-engraved flex grooves on the Nike Free outsole release stiffness in the foam to help support the natural motion of the feet. It's not just the minimalist design and breathable upper materials - Nike Free is like a second skin adapted to the anatomy of the foot and feels as natural as part of your body. Flexible materials, from the upper to the sole, allow unrestricted, natural foot movement.",
